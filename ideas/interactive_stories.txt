Traps to avoid:
-Unclear narrative direction
-Long boring details
-Unexpected events which override or otherwise abuse players' decisions (or which objectively prioritize/reward certain decisions more than others)

Problem:
Players want to tell the story through their own actions. You want to tell your own story which (initially) is probably quite linear.
You have to find the right compromise between coercing players into experiencing certain important (linear) aspects of the story without infringing too much on their freedom as the player.

Types of action:
-Functional: Ordinary actions like eating, walking, buying things, etc..
-Social
-Violent
-Deceptive
...

Try to base the entire story around fun/relevent/interesting actions the player might expect to be able to make, given the circumstances.
Example:
You stumble into a bar
Actions:
-Get drunk
-Fight someone
-Slide a beer to someone
-Play a tune on the jukebox
-Dance
-Eavesdrop on some people
-Sit down at a table
-Go to the toilet
-Sneak behind the counter
-Play a gambling game
-Leave
-Get someone else drunk
-Flirt with someone
-Buy food
-Throw up on someone
-Pickpocket someone
-Call the police
-Impersonate staff
-Spike someone's drink
-Defend someone
Conclusion: Maybe bars aren't very exciting (that's fair).

From here, we can think about what information the player might be able to learn and act on while performing some of these actions.
Knowledge:
-Who the characters are
-Relationships between them
-Who owns the tavern and what they're like
-What secrets does the tavern hold
	-This is purgatory
	-You came here because you died on your quest (main game)
	-That's why everything is weird here
	-Everything outside of the tavern is an illusion
	-How can you escape?
-What is the relationship of the tavern to the surrounding area

We can also think about the available characters in the scene, how they might appropriately respond to the player, what things the player might be able to uncover about them.

Finally we can think about interesting and diverse endings.
