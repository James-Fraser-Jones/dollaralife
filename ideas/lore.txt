I've decided that the kind of symmetric consistency I'm looking for isn't actually present within mythological stories whatsoever.
And also people don't really give a shit about picking holes in these kinds of explanations they're just like "okay they're gods.. got it"
So I shouldn't worry so much about any of this.
Aysymmetry is also kind of fun and whimsical and entertaining etc.. so.

Pretty much greek god mythology is going to be my basis.
Buuut that's only to clarfy points. In general I allow my gods to do (and be) whatever makes sense for the story.
And if there's any question about the inconsistency of that, we can blame it on the (higher up) gods.

Setting is 16th century Europe but on modified map (in map file)
Main character does have a name, you just get to play as her and have some decisions as her (still in-character decisions)
Main character is actually the Daughter of the god of mischief with a woman (unknown to her).

Fallacia - Goddess of trickery, mischief, deceit
Turned herself into a sheep and lured a horny farm boy from Cerechia to have sex with her
Gave birth to Maeandrus - bold tricksy force-of-nature girl
Fallacia then gave nobleman from Cerechia visions of infidelity and gave her to him with the belief the child was his
He became outcast from the rest of his family but was still able to look after his child with his wealth and power, naming her Helena (greek).
Helena became a robin-hood kind of theif from the desire to steal combined with the lack of need for valuable items. Her partner in crime was Lubric.
Lubric is from a similarly privelidged background but has much more smugness (although not afraid to embarrass himself either) where Helena is more firery and authentic.

Having the main two characters come from privelidged background AND being motivated purely by an obsession to steal dispassionately places them in a
position of having so few vulnerabilities that it's unclear how they could end up in a circumstance where they would need to ally themselves with the likes of Liam or
Justice and also makes them extremely unrelatable and unsympathetic as characters.

These characters need to have strong desires and motivations which make them inherently vulnerable and at risk of failure, death, other kinds of trouble etc...

The intent is to have the story begin with extremely low stakes on behalf of Helena and Lubric and for those stakes to increase dramatically as humans of increasing power
and influence seem to take interest in their actions and then gods take interest. Hence the primary goal of the party should shift several times throughout the story.
As they learn more and consider greater risks, greater reward, higher stakes of the progressing situation.

I pretty much need to explain how a story about running an errand naturally turned into a story about killing a god(s)
Sort of how WW1 began in terms of escalation.

The story in the tavern is after the entire party is killed in an encounter (Helena several hours after the rest). And are sitting in purgatory regaining their memory.
And waiting for some divine intervention to send them back the the mortal plane.

The significance of the tavern is in this context and the significance of the characters involved is also in this context since Helena doesn't remember who they are
initially.
